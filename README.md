# Martin's Movies

> > > ## About

</br>

This is a page based on the design available at [Kibtheme](https://klbtheme.com/movify/#).

It contains a landing page with a search bar that allows the user to search for movies by keyword, year or language.

The result is then presented in a new page that contains basic information about the movies in UI Cards. Each movie gives you the option to mark the movie as watched. If marked, the movie is then displayed as watched on the landing page. Allowing the user to keep it in a collection.

The details button in the movie card opens a new page, redirecting the user to the IMDB's info about it.

> Note: All the links in the menu and the login button are display only.
