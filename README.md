> > > ## Idea

</br>

This application allows you to search for movies and keep track of the
ones you have already watched so you don't have to keep browsing the
same movies over and over again.
By marking the movie as watched it disappears from the search and it
gets displayed only in the 'Watched Movies' section on the landing
page.

> > > ## About the Components

</br>

This page contains a landing page with a search bar that allows the user to search for movies by keyword, year or language.

The result is then presented in a new page that contains basic information about the movies in UI Cards.

The details button in the movie card opens a new page, redirecting the user to the IMDB's info about it.

> Note: The menu is yet to be developed.
